# Client team

This is the codebase for members of the client team.

Your top priority is creating a reactive, beautiful, simple user interface and
user experience. Your team leader is responsible for setting what are called
human interaction, or HI, policies -- in other words, if you add a button, does
it look like other buttons, and does it make sense for that button to exist?

Things to think about:
* First get it working, then make it look good. (But don't forget that it should
  look good.)
* Is this the right UI tool for the job? Would a table or a list work better
  here? Is this modular?
* What data does the customer care about? And in what order? Would you want to
  see information on feature x or feature y first?
