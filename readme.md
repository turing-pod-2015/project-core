# Pod Project

## Goals
* learn how to use git and version control systems
* learn what it's like to be a part of a team
* learn what it's like to handle the roles of engineer, PM, and TL

## Project Description

Austin is one of the most educationally lopsided cities in the country. There is more of a quality gap between the best and worst schools in Austin than there is in any other city in Texas. One of the many problems poorer schools face is finding tutors available to help; although tutors are present at UT and at some of the better high schools, they are hard to find and often students don't want to admit to needing help.

This application will connect tutors to potential students. In order to register as a tutor, you must have an @utexas.edu or @*.utexas.edu account; in order to register as a student, you must only live within Austin's city limits. You can be matched with tutors who fit your budgetary, educational, and convenience needs.

## Roles

There are four roles you can choose from, based on availability:
* team engineer: responsible for writing features, maintaining code, etc.
* quality assurance engineer: responsible for writing tests, building continuous integration tools, handling pull requests/merges, etc.
* project manager: work with other project managers to ensure product will be released on time by clearing roadblocks and helping engineers prioritize work
* team leader: set big-picture goals for the team, work with Rohan to ensure that project will be completed by deadlines

## Teams

There are five teams you can choose from (each team except public has one PM and one TL):
* backend: everything from database management, including accounts backend, up to API creation (3x engineer, 3x QA; 8 total)
* frontend: connect with API from backend to create a fully reactive UI/UX on platform of choice (3x engineer, 2x QA; 6 total)
* algo: create intelligence to handle matching of tutors to students (2x engineer, 1x QA; 5 total)
* public: handle the public face of the company, including branding, release cycles, social media, etc. (1x TL; 1 total)

TLs are also responsible for making sure their teammates are happy, and can negotiate with other TLs to handle moving teams around.
