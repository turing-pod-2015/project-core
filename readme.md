## Project Description

Austin is one of the most educationally lopsided cities in the country. There is more of a quality gap between the best and worst schools in Austin than there is in any other city in Texas. One of the many problems poorer schools face is finding tutors available to help; although tutors are present at UT and at some of the better high schools, they are hard to find and often students don't want to admit to needing help.

This application will connect tutors to potential students. In order to register as a tutor, you must have an @utexas.edu or @*.utexas.edu account; in order to register as a student, you must only live within Austin's city limits. You can be matched with tutors who fit your budgetary, educational, and convenience needs.
